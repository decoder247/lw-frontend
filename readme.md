! and then tab
`ctrl+/`


Box or div model:
border-radius: 150px

Google design logic: If it's closer to you, it's more important!!

we can differentiate divs by class or or ids and reference them in css for cusomasiation:
class: .staff{}
id: #idexam{}

when using icons from different sources, there is no worry of a clash between different icons because different websites offer different class names

ted talk: icon and whitespace

bootstrap:

1. Text classes:
    * div class = "text-left"


Mobile first design:

* Make sure it's responsive
* Mobile first (think about design from phone first, scale up!)

Bootstrap uses the classes: containers and row


<div class="col-xs-6">
<div class="col-xs-6">

takes an xs size small screen, of size 6
